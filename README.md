### INSIGHTS INTO ZAYO'S NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE

#### Visualizations
We have attempted to visualize the data in the most intuitive way possible and present it in the form of a dashboard to keep it simple for an end-user.

The dashboard boasts a total of 4 visualizations, each of which gives a unique perspective about the data that was provided to us by Zayo.

  - Our first visualization emphasizes on the 3 most profitable states in the US for Zayo's network expansion. Colorado, Georgia and Texas provide the highest revenue to Zayo, accounting for > 95% of the total annual revenue of Zayo. For this vis, data from the files labeled [ZayoHackathonData_Buildings.csv](https://github.com/INFO-4602-5602/project1-swashbucklers/tree/master/data/ZayoHackathonData_Buildings.csv) and [ZayoHackathonData_CPQs.csv](https://github.com/INFO-4602-5602/project1-swashbucklers/tree/master/data/ZayoHackathonData_CPQs.csv) was used. The vis consists of a map of the US plotted using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and a custom JavaScript file containing coordinates for a bounding box for every state in the US. The states of Colorado, Texas and Georgia are filled in with shades of green such that its brightness is directly proportional to the profit that particular state provides to Zayo. Upon hovering your mouse over the states colored in green, you will notice that a tool-tip pops up with information regarding the total profit that Zayo earns from that state as well as the total number of buildings Zayo has in that state. Clicking any of the colored states will scroll the view down to a data-table that consists of more information regarding Zayo's buildings in the corresponding state, such as the Building ID, Estimated build cost, profits as well as the exact address of a given building ID. A user can sort the data-table with any column as a key by clicking on the up and down arrows near the column name. If a user wishes to search for a particular keyword, he/she may type it into the search box located at the top-right corner of the data table.
  
  - The second visualization shows the distribution of buildings from the [Buildings datasheet](https://github.com/INFO-4602-5602/project1-swashbucklers/blob/master/data/ZayoHackathonData_Buildings.csv) across USA. Using the latitude and longitude provided, each building is plotted on the US map, and we aggregate the number of buildings into a cluster for an area. The visualization is built using [Leaflet JS](http://leafletjs.com/), which is an open source javascript library for building interactive maps. The basic unit of the visualization, the buildings, are represented using building icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/). The type of buildings (On Zayo network, not on Zayo network and build-in-progress) are identified using different icons. Each cluster represents the number of buildings in that area. We can drill-down on each cluster, which is a zoom-in for that area and the cluster splits into smaller clusters and the number of buildings is dynamically updated. Similarly, on zoom-out, the visualization aggregates the clusters into larger clusters. 

  - The third visualization, titled Zayo's Portfolio, uses a tree-map to display the relative distribution of Zayo network across different industries and their corresponding verticals. For this vis, we used data from the file labeled [ZayoHackathonData_Accounts.csv](https://github.com/INFO-4602-5602/project1-swashbucklers/tree/master/data/ZayoHackathonData_Accounts.csv). As for any interaction embedded within this vis, users may hover over any industry shown in the tree-map which will result in a pop-up balloon at the cursor displaying the total revenue generated for Zayo by that industry. Users may drill down into the verticals of that industry by clicking any area that is colored the same (i.e. belongs to the same industry). This transitions the current view to a view containing a tree-map visualization of the verticals associated with that industry and a break-down of the revenue shown in the tool-tip across the corresponding verticals. To return back to the higher-level view of industries, users may click on a rectangular button at the top-right corner of the tree-map which will have the name of the industry that verticals in the current view belong to.
