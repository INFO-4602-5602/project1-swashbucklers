Steps to Run Data Migration

1. Install Django
pip install Django==1.11

2. Checkout the repository

3. cd webapp

4. python manage.py migrate

This should create db.sqllite3 file which is currently in gitignore so you would need to not commit it. 

This is the default database we are using. If somebody wants to change the database change in settings.py but dont commit that.
